* We're gonna need a bigger conference room.

Original guess on attendence was 300 or so.

Interest was higher than anticipated.

Capped at somewhere over 700.

* Go has taken on a life of its own

Community is very involved
Windows port was done entirely by the community

* It's in...
the cloud...or what used to be called servers

systems applications
web applications

* But also on
embeded devices
GoBots!  Go controlled quad copters
desktop applications

* Go is accessible
You can read the entire spec in an evening.
(It's 51 pages long)

Fantastic tutorial

* Go from 'hello world' to 'try & take over the world!'

Take the tour, contribute to a project

* Don't fight, fmt!

Let go fmt win your syntax arguments.  It's better for all involved.



* Thoughts on the first GopherCon

It's worth it to go just to hear Rob Pike speak.
